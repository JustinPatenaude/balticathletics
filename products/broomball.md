  price: 260
  description: |-
    Highly recommended among floor games played with a stick and a ball. The ball is swept along rather than being wildly swung at. The design of the stick also contributes to the safety of the game as the head has a flat surface, is semi-rounded along the bottom and has a big radius around the edges. Head is made from polyurethane Skinex® foam

    Includes:
    - 6 Yellow sticks (36")
    - 6 Orange sticks (36")
    - 1 Ball - 4"
