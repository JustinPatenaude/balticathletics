- testimonial: We really appreciate our personal connection with Baltic. For an experienced
    Phys. Ed. teacher, doing things on-line doesn't always make sense. The staff at
    Baltic are efficient, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond for their
    customers.

- testimonial: The orders were all organized and we will be handing them out to students
    this morning. We couldn't keep the staff from claiming theirs yesterday afternoon,
    so there are a lot of new pieces of school clothing floating around already. Personally,
    I'm very happy with my order and I can see that others are as well. A big "thank
    you" from all of us goes out to you and your company. You guys make this process
    extremely pain-free.

    look great!  Staff and students are very excited to sport their new Ness wear.  We
    appreciate working with you.  The process has been very easy from ordering right
