- testimonial: "We made our first bulk order with Baltic Athletics this year and were
    very pleased with the products and service we received. We appreciate that they
    are a local business and it is because of this that they are able to give more
    personalized service. They are prompt to respond to enquiries and have often shipped
    items to our school within 24 hours. Baltic has definitely become our new ‘go
    to’!  \n\n"

    best prices. I will definitely buy from Baltic Athletics again.
  name: Derek - Green Ridge School
- testimonial: The orders were all organized and we will be handing them out to students
    this morning. We couldn't keep the staff from claiming theirs yesterday afternoon,
    so there are a lot of new pieces of school clothing floating around already. Personally,
    I'm very happy with my order and I can see that others are as well. A big "thank
    you" from all of us goes out to you and your company. You guys make this process
    extremely pain-free.

  testimonial: We received your shipment yesterday for all the school gear and the
    items look great!  Staff and students are very excited to sport their new wear.  We
    appreciate working with you.  The process has been very easy from ordering right
    down to distributing items to all students.
