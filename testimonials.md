    On behalf of Rossburn Fire Department, I would like to send out a huge thank you to everyone involved in taking care of us this year. I have heard nothing but amazing reviews from our firefighters. The clothing is truly amazing.

    Special thank you goes out to Corina. From answering your phone over the weekend or responding to emails quickly…. You truly take pride in your work and our department is very thankful for your dedication. With your expertise you were able to make this project simple and efficient for our department. We couldn’t have done it without you.

    We look forward to working with your company in the future, and will be recommending you as much as we can.

- testimonial: We really appreciate our personal connection with Baltic. For an experienced
    Phys. Ed. teacher, doing things on-line doesn't always make sense. The staff at
    Baltic are efficient, knowledgeable and willing to go above and beyond for their
    customers.

- testimonial: The orders were all organized and we will be handing them out to students
    this morning. We couldn't keep the staff from claiming theirs yesterday afternoon,
    so there are a lot of new pieces of school clothing floating around already. Personally,
    I'm very happy with my order and I can see that others are as well. A big "thank
    you" from all of us goes out to you and your company. You guys make this process
    extremely pain-free.

  testimonial: We received your shipment yesterday for all the Ness gear and the items
    look great!  Staff and students are very excited to sport their new Ness wear.  We
    appreciate working with you.  The process has been very easy from ordering right
    down to distributing items to all students.
