  \**__SPORTS HISTORY LESSON HERE!!**__

  This link to the [Spalding History](https://www.spalding.com/about-spalding.html) has a great history lesson with some really old photos of their first baseball from 1876 to the first basketball in 1894.

  Spalding now focuses only on basketball and softball.
