info: "Started in 1989 by one man, **KNP Headwear** have been around for 30 years,
  with extensive experience in all parts of the accessory, fashion, retail and sportswear
  business. \n\nTheir greatest feat yet - bringing the production back into the hands
  of hardworking Canadians. Local production means a faster lead time, wonderful quality,
  and reduces the carbon footprint. We are excited to present to you a line of Made
  in Canada Stock Toques which we get produced by Silver Spider Knitting, our own
  local manufacturer located in Toronto, Ontario. These toques made to survive Canadian
  Winters and suit Canadian taste. We are so proud, after 30 years of being in the
  headwear industry to now present this amazing locally manufactured option."
