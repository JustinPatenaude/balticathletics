  Detroit, Michagan, 1932 - **Stahls'** began in the family garage of A.C. & Ethel Stahl. Their family business of lettering, screen printing, chenille, and apparel decorating was sparked by a combination of A.C.'s entrepreneurial spirit and his prior work experience with felt material at a manufacturing facility. Known as Commercial Art Products in 1932, one of Stahls' first products sold was chenille lettering sown on a felt background. The felt was cut by hand; A.C. eventually developed the process of cutting material by using a die and punch press.

  Today, just as in 1932, Stahls' remains the innovator and leader in pre-cut and custom athletic numbers, letters, and logos.
