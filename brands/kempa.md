  **Kempa** stands for handball. As a move and as a brand. The sport is characterised by agility, power, emotions and goosebump moments.

  Kempa exists since 2002, but have been famous for much longer. Almost 50 years before the brand was founded, on 24 March 1954, the legendary Kempa trick celebrated its world premiere. Invented, developed and executed by two-time field handball world champion Bernhard Kempa. The brand is named after him.
