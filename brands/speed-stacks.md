  Sport stacking originated in the early 1980's in southern California and received national attention in 1990 on a segment of the "Tonight Show", with Johnny Carson. That was where it first captured the imagination of Bob Fox, who was then an elementary classroom teacher in Colorado.

  **Speed Stacks** spreads nationally. In 1998, Bob was asked to present sport stacking to Texas. After a tremendous response Speed Stacks, Inc. was born as a small home business designed to promote sport stacking and be a resource to physical education teachers. And the sport continued to grow.
