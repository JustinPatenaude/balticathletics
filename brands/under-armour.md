info: "**Under Armour** was founded on September 25, 1996 by Kevin Plank, a then 24-year-old
  former special teams captain of the University of Maryland football team. Plank
  initially began the business from his grandmother's basement in Washington, D.C.\n\nPlank
  opted to use the British spelling \"armour\" in the company name because the toll-free
  vanity number was still available for that version. \n\nUnder Armour is now a well
  known sports brand."
