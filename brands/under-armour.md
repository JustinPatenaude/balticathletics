  **Under Armour** was founded on September 25, 1996 by Kevin Plank, a then 24-year-old former special teams captain of the University of Maryland football team. Plank initially began the business from his grandmother's basement in Washington, D.C.

  Plank opted to use the British spelling "armour" in the company name because the toll-free vanity number was still available for that version.

  Under Armour is now a well known sports brand.
