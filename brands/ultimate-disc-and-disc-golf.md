info: Since its creation in the late 60s, Ultimate has gained worldwide recognition
  as a fast-paced, low-cost sport that emphasizes sportsmanship through Spirit of
  the Game. It’s easy to learn, requires little equipment and can easily be played
  in any open space. The basic skills of the game – throwing, catching, running and
  jumping –make for an easy transition for athletes from other sports, both team and
  individual. New participants often indicate that the strong sense of community at
  all levels of play make for a rewarding experience on and off the field.
