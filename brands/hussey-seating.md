  **ABOUT:**

  Clarin was founded in 1925 by Werner Clarin, the innovator of all of the principle designs that are presently offered by folding chair manufacturers. In 1928 Clarin Corporation made the first all-steel folding chair manufactured in the United States.

  World War II material shortages actually helped the company’s growth when it switched to wood folding chairs and government sub-contract work to stay operational.

  After World War II, the demand for portable seating increased greatly because of the rising enrollment in public schools, and Clarin grew steadily as the market did.

  Known for providing years of dependable service, it is not uncommon for schools and venues to still be using Clarin chairs dating all the way back to the 1960’s and 70’s.

  In 2011 Clarin became part of the Hussey Seating Company’s family of products.
