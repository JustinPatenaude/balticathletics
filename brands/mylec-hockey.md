info: "**Mylec Hockey** has been a leading innovator and manufacturer of street hockey
  equipment since 1970 when it was founded in Winchendon, Massachusetts. In 1972 Ray
  Leclerc developed the first Orange “no bounce” street hockey ball, that allowed
  the game to be played on all surfaces and is still the standard today for street
  hockey."
