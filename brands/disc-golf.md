  **Disc golf** is a flying disc sport in which players throw a disc at a target; it is played using rules similar to golf. It is usually played on a course of 9 or 18 holes. Players complete a hole by throwing a disc from a tee area toward a target, throwing again from the landing position of the disc until the target is reached. Usually, the number of throws a player uses to reach each target are tallied (often in relation to par), and players seek to complete each hole in the lowest number of total throws.

  The game is played in about 40 countries and, as of 2019, there are 53,366 active members of the PDGA worldwide.
