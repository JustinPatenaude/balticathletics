    and gets it out to you. She helps out wherever is needed, so her job varies day
    to day, keeping her on her toes!\n\nSuzie enjoys spending time in nature, and
    can often be found at the lake, camping, fishing, or boating. Since recently finishing
    two years on mission trips, she is now a youth ministry coordinator for various
